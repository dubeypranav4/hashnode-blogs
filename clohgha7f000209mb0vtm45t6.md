First off, what is Spring Batch? Let’s cover that quickly:

“Spring Batch is an enterprise-specific, batch processing framework (Batch processing is **the method computers use to periodically complete high-volume, repetitive data jobs**) to allow the development of highly robust and reliable systems whether in a distributed or monolithic set of systems.”

Now that we have got that covered, let’s have a quick glance at how does Batch achieves this (the below details are referenced from [a great resource on Spring Batch at livebook.manning.com](https://livebook.manning.com/book/spring-batch-in-action/chapter-9/1)):

*   **Transaction management:** TM affects the reliability and robustness of Spring Batch jobs. Usually, in a request-response driven system this is achieved by programmatic transaction demarcations or declarative transaction management. The same problem of ACID turns out to be complicated for Batch processing systems.
*   Chunk based processing: Chunk based processing refers to aggregating and transforming a subset of data so that they can be processed later on. With the onset of Spring Batch v2.0, there are two options of these subset of dataset: Tasklets and chunk processings. Baeldung has a really great explanation for the same.
*   Declarative I/O: Declarative I/O is a methodology to abstract away the I/O flow logic required for Batch to take input and output the desired outcome. Declarative programming is a high-level programming concept, which is the opposite of imperative programming.
*   Start/Stop/Restart/Retry/Skip: Batch also offers mechanisms to start/stop or restart a job. A batch job needs to be: **Robust**, **Traceable** and **Restartable.** This allows the [batch jobs to be bulletproof](https://livebook.manning.com/book/spring-batch-in-action/chapter-8/ch08lev1sec1) to: non-fatal exception, transient exceptions, an execution failure and much more.
*   Web based administration interface ([Spring Cloud Data Flow](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow)): Spring Cloud Data Flow provides tools to create complex topologies for streaming and batch data pipelines. The data pipelines consist of [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) apps, built using the [Spring Cloud Stream](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream) or [Spring Cloud Task](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-task/) microservice frameworks.
